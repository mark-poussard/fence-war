# Fence War

Fence war is a small JavaScript game inspired by a high school pen & paper game I used to play with friends.

You can play it at : https://mark.poussard.io/fence-war/

## How to play

The aim of the game is to color as many squares of the grid in your color. 

To do so, each turn you can place a new fence on the grid.

Placing the last fence around a square gives you ownership of that square and you can place another fence.

The winner is the player that possesses the most squares once no more fences can be placed.

## Game modes

You can play from 2 to 5 players on any grid size from 2x2 to 7x7.

Clicking on a player label will toggle between easy computer, hard computer and player control.
